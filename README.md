# CF-A6-Employee-Attrition
CareerFoundry Achievement 6 Project: Employee Attrition
Sourced data to investigate people data, namely employee attrition at a fictional company.
This company's Human Resources department seek to understand how certain diversity identities, such as gender and age, impact an employee's tenure (i.e., length of service).
Ultimately, this company would like to understand the diversity of its workforce in order to take steps towards increasing it, so as to understand how to allocate resources towards initiatives, projects, programs, and policies.

## Key Questions and Objectives
- How does age, gender, and/or role impact attrition?
- What is the breakdown of gender and generation among varying lengths of service?
- How many men vs. women are staying longer at the company?

## Data Set
- The dataset is available for download from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data/code)
